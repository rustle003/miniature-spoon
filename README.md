# miniature-spoon

This project, miniature-spoon, is a small project written to explore interactions between a mix of scala, spark, and a coffee-themed hive database. The configurations of this project are specific to the machine on which it was written; however, anyone is welcome to change the configuration and adapt it to their machine most of which--referring to the configuration--will need to be done directly on the source file in src/main/scala/conn/util/LocalHiveCon.scala.
